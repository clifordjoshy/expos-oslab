# expos

This repository contains my implementation of Project eXpOS (eXperimental Operating System) done as part of the Operating Systems Laboratory course I took in 2021. Also included are a few shell scripts I made to optimise my workflow.

More details about the project can be found on the [website](https://exposnitc.github.io/).

This branch contains the single-core implementation of the OS. The dual-core implementation can be found in the [nexpos](https://github.com/clifordjoshy/expos-oslab/tree/nexpos) branch.
